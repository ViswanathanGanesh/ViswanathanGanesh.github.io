# Katy's personal website

## Quick start
Fork this repo, then rename the repository to **yourgithubusername.github.io**. 
Your Jekyll site will often be viewable immediately at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io>.


## More information
Jekyll is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)). 
Jekyll Now makes it easier to create your Jekyll site by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.


## About
This is a personal website that was largely adopted and customized from 
[**jekyll-now**](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). You're welcome
to borrow/repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, I'd apprecaite
attribution and a link back [here](https://khinkelman.github.io/about).
